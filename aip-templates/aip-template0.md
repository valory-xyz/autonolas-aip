This is the template for AIPs.

When opening a pull request to submit your AIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename,`identifier-AIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`. Note that the the identifier will be later assigned by the reviewer.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Simple Summary

This is a simplified and accessible explanation of the AIP.

## Abstract

Abstract is a short technical summary (~200 word) that describes the technical issue being addressed. 


## Motivation

The motivation section should describe the "why" of this AIP. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during the discussion.

## Security Considerations

All AIPs must contain a discussion of the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Including information that might be important for security discussions and surface risks of the proposal. This can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal.


## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any AIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the AIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
